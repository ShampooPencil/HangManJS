# HangManJS
Use Javascript to make a clean HangMan game. Make simple but add cool features also after game is completed and the code logic is done with.
//UPDATE 11/20/2019 :
    SO IT WORKS.....SORT-OF. WHEN I TYPE THE RIGHT LETTER IN THE UNDER-LINES, IT ALWAYS PUTS THE FIRST CORRECT USER KEYPRESS IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE UNDER-LINE OF WORD. 
    THEN, WHEN I TYPE A LETTER NOT IN THE NEXT WORD BUT LATER ON IN THE WORD, IN GOES TO THE SECOND LETTER IN THE UNDERLINED HANGMAN WORD. SO I HAVE TO FIGURE/DECODE THE PROBLEMS AND FIX THEM! GOOD LUCK MYSELF!
    //FIRST SETUP:
//      its probably the best to just make this logic 
//      one big function. When clicked it will 
//      showed the lines of the word first. On the right put a pic of a hangman symbol.

//LOGIC: 
// Just some basic syntax im going to need:
// Math.random, 
// arrays of hangman words
// for loops
// some vars to organize everything(orginizing will help alot!)
// Big logic is filling in the empty lines of hangman letters. 
// Theres many way i can go about doing it, probably a for loop 
// guesses will be in the loop until the player quits or gets the word right.
// (maybe after that works we can show the word if player quits )
// 
// In the beginning, the player can pick unlimited guesses.(after that works, 
// we wil pick limit of how many picked the player can guess)
