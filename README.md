# HangManJS
Use Javascript to make a clean HangMan game. Make simple but add cool features also after game is completed and the code logic is done with.
//UPDATE 11/20/2019 :
    SO IT WORKS.....SORT-OF. WHEN I TYPE THE RIGHT LETTER IN THE UNDER-LINES, IT ALWAYS PUTS THE FIRST CORRECT USER KEYPRESS IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE UNDER-LINE OF WORD. 
    THEN, WHEN I TYPE A LETTER NOT IN THE NEXT WORD BUT LATER ON IN THE WORD, IN GOES TO THE SECOND LETTER IN THE UNDERLINED HANGMAN WORD. SO I HAVE TO FIGURE/DECODE THE PROBLEMS AND FIX THEM! GOOD LUCK MYSELF!
